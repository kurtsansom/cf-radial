|===
| *Variable name* | *Dimension* | *Type* | *Units* | *Comments*
|volume_number | |int | |Volume numbers are sequential, relative to some arbitrary start time, and may wrap.
|platform_type | |string | a|

Options are: “_radar_”, “_lidar_”

Assumed “_radar_” if missing.

|primary_axis | |string | a|
Options are: +
_“axis_z”, “axis_y”, “axis_x”, “axis_z_prime”, “axis_y_prime”, “axis_x_prime”._

See section 9 for details.

Assumed “_axis_z_” if missing.

|time_coverage_start | |double a|
ISO8601 string: +
“seconds since YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS” or

“seconds since YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS”

|UTC time of first ray in file.
|time_coverage_end | |double a|
ISO8601 string: +
“seconds since YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS” or

“seconds since YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS”

|UTC time of last ray in file.
|latitude | |double |degrees_north |Latitude of instrument, +
using WGS84. +
For a mobile platform, this is a latitude at the start of the volume.
|longitude | |double |degrees_east |Longitude of instrument, +
using WGS84 +
For a mobile platform, this is the longitude at the start of the volume.
|altitude | |double |meters |Altitude of instrument, above mean sea level, using WGS84 and EGM2008 geoid corrections. +
For a scanning radar, this is the center of rotation of the antenna. +
For a mobile platform, this is the altitude at the start of the volume.
|altitude_agl | |double |meters |Altitude of instrument above ground level. +
Omit if not known.
|sweep_group_name |(sweep) |string | |Array of names for sweep groups. +
Allows the user to locate the sweep groups directly.
|sweep_fixed_angle |(sweep) |float |degrees |Array of fixed angles for sweeps. This summarizes the fixed angles for all of the sweeps, so that a user does not need to read individual sweep groups to determine the fixed angles. The value should be copied from the sweep_fixed_angle attribute in the sweep groups.
|status_str | |string | |General-purpose string for storing any information that is not included in other parts of the data structure. Format can be simple text, +
XML, JSon, etc.

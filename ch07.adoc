[[root-groups, Chapter 7, optional root group]]

== Root group metadata groups

The base _CF/Radial_ convention, as described above, covers the minimum set of NetCDF elements which are required to locate radar/lidar data in time and space.

Additional groups may be included to provide metadata on other aspects of the system.

These groups reside in the root group, and are optional.

=== The _radar_parameters_ sub-group

This group holds radar parameters specific to a radar instrument:

=== The _radar_calibration_ sub-group

For a radar, a different calibration is required for each pulse width. Therefore the calibration variables are arrays.

==== Variables

The meaning of the designations used in the calibration variables are as follows for dual-polarization radars:

* '*h*': horizontal channel
* '*v*': vertical channel
* '*hc*': horizontal co-polar (h transmit, h receive)
* '*hx*' – horizontal cross-polar (v transmit, h receive)
* '*vc*': vertical co-polar (v transmit, v receive)
* '*vx*' – vertical cross-polar (h transmit, v receive)

For single polarization radars, the '*h*' quantities should be used.

=== The _lidar_calibration_ sub-group

At the time of writing, the contents of this group have not been defined.

=== The _georeference_correction_ sub-group

The following additional variables are used to quantify errors in the georeference data for moving platforms (see 5.4). These are constant for a volume.

If any item is omitted, the value is assumed to be 0.

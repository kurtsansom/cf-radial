== Abstract

The CfRadial2 format is intended to provide a standard, modern, self-describing way to store radar and lidar data in native radial (polar) coordinates.

CfRadial2 is built on NetCDF-4, which is in turn built on HDF5. NetCDF-4 and HDF5 are both up-to-date technology for efficiently and easily storing scientific and engineering data.

The purpose of this document is to specify a CF2-compliant NetCDF format for radar and lidar moments data in radial (i.e. polar) coordinates.

The intention is that the format should, as far as possible, comply with the CF conventions for gridded data. However, the current CF 2.0 convention does not support radial radar/lidar data. Therefore, extensions to the conventions will be required.

The current CF conventions are documented at:
